# Assignment Template

### Rules
1. Asking your peers for help is okay, but try not to copy and paste their code
2. If you get any code from peers or online sources, cite your sources
3. Make sure your code is compatible with Python3 (some things you look up will work for Python2 but not Python3)
4. If working with a partner (when allowed) make sure to understand all parts of the code, ask your partner to explain it if you do not 	understand it
5. For partner work, try to contribute to all aspects of the code, working on functions together is better than splitting up

**General rule of thumb:** If you can explain your code in your own words, that proves that you can understand it


### Code formatting
An example has been provided in this repository, and is linked [here](https://github.com/UofAScienceCamps2018/individual-assignment-template/blob/master/individual_template.py)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

"""
The name of your file
Your first and last name

Description of your file

A link to any external sources you use
*** looking online for help is fine, just make sure you provide a link to the websites you used ***
"""

# Import statements, in alphabetical order

# Public variables (try to avoid using them if possible)


# Comment that describes the following code/function
def function1():

# Comment that describes the following code/function
def function2():
  # Code here
  
  
# Comment that describes the following code/function
def function3():

# This statement will allow your file to be properly run from the terminal
if __name__ == "__main__":
