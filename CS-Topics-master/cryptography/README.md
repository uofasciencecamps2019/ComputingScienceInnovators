# Cryptography Assignment

### Task
**Create a caesar cipher that adheres to the following rules**

1. It will ask the user for a message to encrypt via input from the command line
2. It will either ask the user for a shift number to use (any integer from 1-25) **or** use one that is hard-coded
3. It will follow the code formatting/style guide below, returning the translated message to be printed in the main function

**Create a substitution cipher that adheres to the following rules**

1. It will ask the user for a message to encrypt via input from the command line
2. It will either use a hard-coded key **or** use a randomly shuffled version of the alphabet
3. It will follow the code formatting/style guide below, returning the translated message to be printed in the main function

### Rules
1. Asking your peers for help is okay, but try not to copy and paste their code
2. If you get any code from peers or online sources, cite your sources
3. Make sure your code is compatible with Python3 (some things you look up will work for Python2 but not Python3)

**General rule of thumb:** If you can explain your code in your own words, that proves that you can understand it


### Code formatting
An example has been provided in this repository, and is linked [here](https://github.com/UofAScienceCamps2018/individual-assignment-template/blob/master/individual_template.py)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

"""
The name of your file
Your first and last name

Description of your file

A link to any external sources you use
*** looking online for help is fine, just make sure you provide a link to the websites you used ***
